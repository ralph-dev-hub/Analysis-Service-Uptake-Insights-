 ## Task:

*As the Strategic Information Lead, I developed this dashboard to make repeated tasks reproduciable.*

* I wrote Sql Queries to Generate important insights and reports for managers to make an data driven decisions.*

* Create Stored Procedures so that managers can extract the reports based on the filters.*

* Create an fully functional Dashbord for Data Driven Decisiosn, which gives insights on various interventions like clinical services, education and economic empowermrnt.*


## Tech stack used in the project:

* MySQL*
* MS Excel*
* Power BI*

## Work Flow:
### SQL Workbench

* Data was Loading into Mysql and database was designed by establishing relationships in a Snowflake schema format between the tables with ERD in MySQL.*
* Data was ready for Data Analysis and key metrics were Derived, for all the requests from Product owners*
* Stored Procedures were created for the comples Queries so that Product owners can extract  reports by necessary filters*
* An Data pipeline was established in deriving Metrics, with many Data Cleaning methods implemented in between.

### PowerBI Dashboard

* Connected Power BI to MySQL and Excel, transformed data by establishing a data pipeline (ETL) using Power Query, Data Modelling to establish relations by snowflake schema and initial Data validation was done against benchmark values.*
* Utilized DAX to create calculated columns and measures, and built a dynamic dashboard with KPI’s for sales, finance, marketing, and supply chain.*
* Published a report on Power BI service for user acceptance testing (UAT) and Data validation through Excel Analyze.*
* Incorporated stakeholder feedback to create an Executive Dashboard, resolved quality issues, optimized dashboard performance, and deployed the dashboard to Power BI service with gateway setup to MySQL Database and local Excel files for Automatic Data Refresh.*
* Various Project Management Skills like Project charter, stakeholder mapping analysis, Kanban board for task assignment to improve productivity.*
* A Designed dashboard with up to three levels of analysis, was able to ask the stakeholders many why’s, to their top performing, product, markets, customers, % changes and trends in P&L metrics, supply chain forecast accuracy for inventory management has helped to improve overall business.*
* Created intuitive dashboards(Views), specifically targeted to various departments to give an overview of the company's performance.*
